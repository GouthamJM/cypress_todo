```bash
## clone this repo to a local directory
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cypress-example-todomvc.git

## cd into the cloned repo
cd cypress_todo

## install the node_modules
yarn

## start the local webserver
yarn start
```

The `yarn start` script will spawn a webserver on port `8888` which hosts the TodoMVC app.

You can verify this by opening your browser and navigating to: [`http://localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888)
